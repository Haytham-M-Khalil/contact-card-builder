# `lib/` — vendored third-party libraries

These files are **committed to the repo on purpose** so the app is fully
self-contained: GitHub Pages serves them from this same site, so there's no CDN
dependency and the app works offline. There is **no `npm install`** and no build
step — the browser loads these `.js` files directly via `<script>` tags.

> Libraries are downloaded into this folder in the feature step that first needs
> them (see the roadmap in `CLAUDE.md`), then committed.

## Libraries used

| File                  | Library / version       | Used for                                       | Source |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `qrcode.js`           | qrcode-generator 1.4.4  | Building the QR matrix from the vCard text      | https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrcode-generator@1.4.4/qrcode.js |
| `jspdf.umd.min.js`    | jsPDF (pending)         | Generating the PDF; QR drawn as vector squares  | added in step 5 (PDF) |

## Rules for this folder
- **Pin a specific version** when vendoring; record the version and source URL here.
- Don't edit the library files by hand — re-download to upgrade and note the new version.
- Prefer the unminified build where it's small enough to keep things readable while learning.
